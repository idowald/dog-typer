This project was bootstrapped with [Create React App](https://github.com/facebook/create-react-app).

# Dog typer
This project was created with Create react app + redux + sagas + jest + material ui

I also used [react-tiny-virtual-list](https://github.com/clauderic/react-tiny-virtual-list) for simplicity reasons.

# How to run

1. clone the project `git clone https://github.com/idowald/dog-typer`
2. run install `yarn` or `npm i`
3. run the dev script (although also build is fine) `npm start`

Enjoy

You can also run test and build
